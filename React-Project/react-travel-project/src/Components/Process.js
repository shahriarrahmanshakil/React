            Everyone has their own idea of what a vacation is. Maybe it’s lounging by the pool and drinking cocktails, or perhaps it’s backpacking in the mountains. Your travel style will affect what kind of destination you choose. So think about what you want to get out of your vacation. Are you hoping to relax and get away from a bustling city? Do you enjoy visiting historical, cultural, and archeological sites? Do you love being in nature, or do you prefer a city with all of its conveniences? Thinking about these questions will help you start to narrow down your list of potential destinations.
